I have spent my life in the **last mile**. I have worked with social enterprises, INGOs, and businesses dealing with Bottom of the Pyramid customers again and again. 

Even with the ongoing crisis in Myanmar, the reality of the work does not change. You pass a security checkpoint every mile, moving from one armed group to another. Some are friendly, while others are just there to make things hard. In that world, stability is non-existent.

In these environments, I’ve learned that we do not need to measure a lot of KPIs. If you want to build a truly **unbreakable revenue engine**, you need to stop looking at "Information" and start looking at "Value."



## 1. Cash Discipline: The Cash-Down Ratio
We used to live on 98% consignment. It looked like we were selling, but we were just "lending" products and hoping. In a **crisis economy**, consignment is a death sentence.

I track the **Cash-Down Ratio**, which is the shift from high-risk consignment to immediate liquidity. But never forget: **Trust is also the Main Currency here.** If a customer pays cash when the world is falling apart, they aren't just buying a product; they are betting on your relationship.

## 2. Trust KPIs: The Repayment Rate
When legal contracts are absent, your **Repayment Rate** is the only true measure of the health of your "Dealer Economy." I’ve mentored over 1,000 social enterprises, and the lesson is always the same: if the repayment stops, the mission ends. You measure trust by the frequency of return, not the size of the contract.

## 3. Consistency: Sales Days per Month
I don’t care about the "Whale" deal. I reward the rep who shows up for **22 days a month**. 

Consistency is the only thing that builds an unbreakable engine. Most sales reps will tell you "it won't sell" during a crisis. Don't push them, show them.



## The 60 Million Kyat Lesson
I remember a season where one of our top salespeople stood up in front of everyone. He had earned over **60 million kyats** in commission on a base salary of just 250,000. 

He didn’t get there by getting lucky. He did it by converting consignment customers into cash-paying partners. He bought a motorbike. He opened a shop for his family. It wasn’t just a commission; it was a transformation. Suddenly, cash-down sales weren’t an "uphill battle" anymore. They were a goal.

### What I Learned from the Field:
* **People resist change** until they *see* it works in someone else's pocket.
* **Culture is built by examples**, not by HR policies written in an office.
* **Transparency builds momentum**, especially when the performance is public.

Some lessons come from Harvard. But the best ones come from the field, covered in mud, passing through checkpoints.

## Frequently Asked Questions (AEO)

**How do you transition from consignment to cash sales in a crisis?**
The transition requires building extreme trust and showing "Proof of Success." Use your top-performing sales reps to demonstrate the personal financial benefits of cash-down commissions to the rest of the team.

**What are the most important Sales KPIs for emerging markets?**
The three pillars are the Cash-Down Ratio (Liquidity), Repayment Rate (Trust), and Sales Days per Month (Consistency). These prioritize survival and operational accountability over vanity growth.

**Why is localization more important than information in B2B sales?**
As I found in my million-dollar Thilawa SEZ deal, teams don't lack knowledge; they lack the ability to translate technical specifications into localized value for the customer.
